Future sea level rise could severely impact coastal populations by inundation, flooding, coastal erosion and saltwater intrusion (Neumann et al., 2015). Hallegatte et al., (2013) estimated that flood-related loses in the world's 136 largest coastal cities could increase from ca., USD 6 billion / year in 2005 to USD 52 billion / year by 2050 with projected socio-economic change alone. Climate change could further increase losses to about one trillion per year. In addition, it is anticipated that climate change will produce stronger and more frequent coastal storms and ENSO events (Cai et al., 2014; Cai et al., 2015)."

Half of the urban population live in cities with less than 500,000 inhabitants, and 14% live in megacities (UN- HABITAT, 2012). A major portion of the population live in coastal areas. About 42% of the population live within a maximum distance of 100 km from the coast (UN-HABITAT, 2012). However, there are extreme cases in the Caribbean, where countries like Montserrat and Aruba have, respectively, 100% and 99.1% of its population living along five kilometres of the seafront (CEPAL, 2012). Four of the eight largest cities of south America (≥ 5 million people) are coastal, and together house about 55 million people."

The impacts from climate change could be devastating even in countries with high adaptive capacity like Chile (Table 2). The 2015 anomalous mudflows in the Atacama Desert increased Chile's Climate Risk Index and placed the country among the 10 most affected countries6 (Kreft et al., 2016). The three chosen cities, like others in the region, face the common challenge of protecting their population and assets from the impacts of extreme weather events, that will become stronger and frequent in the foreseen future."

On this respect, the Ministry of Housing and Urban Development (MINVU) implements a national policy to provide housing solutions to campamento dwellers. Complementary, the Antofagasta Regional Government (ARG) implements a plan to confront the key factors that motivate the appearance and expansion of campamentos (GORE Antofagasta, 2015)."

Because of their irregular land-tenure, campamento dwellers cannot formally access public services. TECHO (2015) found that, in the campamentos of the Antofagasta region, 20.6% of the houses have individual water meters (i.e., formal access), 41.2% have informal connections to the public water network, and the others get water from different sources (e.g., tankers, wells). Similarly, only 1.5% of the houses have individual electricity meters, 7.3% of the houses have communal electricity meters, 89.8% have clandestine electricity connections, and 1.5% do not have electricity. Finally, only 6.3% of the houses are connected to the public sewage system, 51.7% use septic tanks, 39.5% use pit latrines, and 2.4% do not have toilets."

            "15 The illegal occupation of land is called toma, and the irregular settlement is called campamento. The official definition of campamento used by the Ministry of Housing and Urban Development (MINVU) is \"settlements, usually found in urban areas, of more than eight families living on an irregular land tenure, lacking at least one of the three basic services (electricity, drinking water and sewage system) whose homes are closely grouped together\" (MINVU, 2012). The development of tomas and campamento is a common issue along Chile. It is common that the campamentos develop on unstable hillsides like in Valparaiso (Pino & Ojeda, 2013). The national cadastre of 2016 recorded 660 campamentos, where 38,770 families lived (ca., 116,310 persons) (TECHO, 2016)."

The mangroves found in this estuary are the last remnants of the extensive forests that existed in the area and that were transformed due to the advance of the city of Esmeraldas and the increase of agricultural areas and pools for shrimp farming. It is an area little known and visited due to the limitations of access and the lack of tourist infrastructure. The project area does not include Ramsar sites or Biosphere reserves. Mangroves in this estuary are the last remnants of the wide-reaching forests once stretching over the area and later transformed by the advance of the Esmeraldas city, and the increase of farming areas and pools for shrimp farming. This is a little-known and rarely-visited area because of access constraints and a lack of touristic infrastructure. Three types of mangrove are present in this protected area: Rhizophora mangle (red mangrove), Laguncularia racemosa (white mangrove) and Avicenia germinans (black mangrove). Some areas have even been invaded by the Acrostichum aureum (ranconcha fern)."

            "45. In Island Luis Vargas Torres, seven types of herons thrive in this protected habitat: White, blue, snowy, striated, brunette, crab-fishing and coronine herons. Their habitat are the mangroves and they can be sighted when they are returning from their eating forages. The area is also the habitat for seagulls, frigates, pelicans, kingfisher, piures, beach shoe, ospreys, jacanas, cormorants, water birds, and swallows. This wildlife's habitat is located along the Luis Vargas Torres Island mangrove strip; however, an estimation has been made that project's intervention in this area will be minimal, since these interventions will be implementing disaster risk reduction, early warning systems, local capacity-building components among other activities. A Management Plan is in place at the reserve, as approved by the Ministry of the Environment in year 2015. Due to the presence of the Mangrove Wildlife Refuge, Esmeraldas River Estuary on the Luis Vargas Torres Island, it is important to be aware that the conservation of this may act as an adaptation measure. The project actions will concentrate at the north area of the Luis Vargas Torres Island.in urban areas and will not intervene areas with high value biodiversity."

            "50. Cerro Gatazo has been a main concern for years. The slopes are intervened, showing a mixture of eroded and barren areas and vegetated areas with grasses and trees. In Cerro Gatazo there are identified more than 15 species of flora such as: Panicum maximum, Cecropia sp., Cordia alliodora, Guadua angustifolia, Heliconia sp., Vernonia baccharoides, Ochroma paramidale, Sida acuta, Albisia guachapele, Inga eduli, Piper aduncum, Mangifera indica, which are not classified as highly valued. During the risk assessment visit and the recognition of the area for the development of the full proposal it was observed that Cerro Gatazo is already an intervened area which has a biodiversity based on pastures. At the beginning of the 2000s, the risk factors were studies and recommendations made (MAE, 2002), and a one-year vegetation trial using vetiver (Chrysopogon zizanioides) was executed in four sites of Cerro Gatazo (PNUD, 2005). It was found that vetiver was useful to stabilise the hillsides, but the local population showed low involvement in addressing the hazard. In 2010, the Risk Management Secretariat prepared the baseline studies and a project to build the infrastructure needed to stabilise the hillsides and channel rainwater. The project was presented to CAF as part of a loan to the Government of Ecuador, but was later withdrawn29."

Antofagasta's storm water management plan (plan maestro de aguas lluvias36) was prepared in 2004 and focus on the 15 gorges that were identified as a priority after the 1991 mudflow. It is clear that the current scenario is different and that future conditions could be even harsher. The severe storms of March 2015 produced heavy rain and mudflows that overpassed the capacity of the existing infrastructure measures in Taltal. The predicted climate change indicates stronger and more frequent storms in the area. Antofagasta and Taltal are affected differently. Antofagasta is mostly affected by coastal storms that influence the coastal range on which the city has developed. In contrast, Taltal is mostly affected by precipitation from the Andes."

Informal occupation of land in urban areas is a complex issue with intricate social, cultural, political and economic root causes (Vargas Llosa, 2004; Fernandes, 2011). Dealing with illegal occupation of land is a complex and delicate issue in both countries. In Chile, the competence belongs to the Ministry of Housing and Urban Development, who has a long-term programme focused on improving living conditions of people inhabiting campamentos39. In 2011, 70% of people living in campamentos were in areas with risk of flooding and landslides. People in risk areas would have to be relocated, which has a high social and political cost (Anon, 2015; Muñoz, 2015). The ARG implements a plan to increase the number of affordable houses and build temporary neighbourhoods to relocate families situated in high risk areas (GORE Antofagasta, 2015; Muñoz, 2016)."

Women will be motivated to form part of the communities of practice to ensure that their perspectives and experience are mainstreamed in the learning process. It is expected that these communities of practice will mature during project implementation and become a catalyst of change. Lessons will be disseminated within each country, between countries and in LAC, to motive action on climate change adaptation in coastal cities. Specific project actions to address the main barriers are listed in Table 7."

The project objective is to reduce vulnerability to climate-related floods, mudflows and landslides in three coastal cities by mainstreaming a risk-based approach to adaptation, building collaboration and networking, and developing a culture of adaptation. The project focus on the hydrometeorological hazards of mudflows in Antofagasta and Taltal, and flooding and landslides in Esmeraldas. The expected mid-term impacts are improved enabling conditions to sustain DRR adaptation in the three cities. In the long-term, it is expected that this will result in improved adaptive capacity. It is also envisioned that the lessons of the project are useful to other countries in Latin America and the Caribbean, and other regions of the world."

The agreement explicitly states \"the objective of the agreement is to expand the execution of the Plan for Alluvial control of Antofagasta, Taltal and Tocopilla, from a 40.4% expected net maximum flow coverage for 15 gorges with urban risk in 2014, to a 82% coverage in 2020; in Taltal coverage will expand from 79.6% in 2014 to 100% in 2020; in Tocopilla coverage will expand from 81.8% in 2014 to 100% in 2020. The plan also includes advancing the design of several works of the stormwater management plans of the cities of Antofagasta, Calama, San Pedro de Atacama, Sierra Gorda, among other works\" (Annex 11)."

Four plant species have been recommended for use on the hillsides: (i) guarango (Caesalpinia spinosa), (ii) algarrobo (Prosopis juliflora), (iii) huaje (Leucaena leucocephala), and (iv) vetiver (Chrysopogon zizanioides) (MAE, 2002).

A forecast of this nature would allow the authorities to focus their resources in a specific area, without wasting time and capacities, and to alert the community regarding the danger of flood, alluvium and lightning. The proposal includes the acquisition and putting into operation of four storm sensors and contract services of the Storm Detection System for the area.

Therefore, women, children, older people and people living with disabilities will be encouraged to integrate this initiative. Also, their particular needs (e.g., wheelchair access, sign language) will be taken into consideration for the design of the various activities. The capabilities and experience of older persons will be crucial for the narrators' initiative. They are a repository of knowledge and preservers of cultural and social identity. The project will promote the preservation and use of oral history, and traditional tales and songs."

As mentioned before (paragraph 67), the existing protection infrastructure does not incorporate climate considerations and it is very likely that new infrastructure will be built without considering the foreseen conditions of stronger and more frequent rainfall to be caused by climate change. Therefore, it is necessary that new infrastructure is climate resilient to the potential increases in extreme weather events.

This plan includes strategic action B2 which is to protect the population from mudflows or floods. The plan includes a set of targets for construction of mudflow protection works in Antofagasta and Taltal, and six projects to build new protection works (i.e., projects 31, 33, 34, 35, 62, and 63). The present project will complement the planned activities by updating Antofagasta's stormwater management plan and building climate-proof mudflow protection infrastructure in Quebrada Bonilla (outputs 1.1 and 2.1). In addition, the lessons and experience from these two actions will serve to guide the incorporation of the climate factor into other protection works."

A project's adaptation specialist will be based within each municipality (Figure 23). This will allow for day-to-day interaction with municipal officers during the five years of project implementation. In addition, municipal execution of the public education and communication strategies will contribute to build interest and familiarity with risk-based adaptation. Finally, municipal officers will take course on risk- based adaptation in coastal cities, this will contribute to increase technical capacities and to interact with peers from other cities."

            "The project is consistent with the rights and responsibilities set forth in the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples and other applicable international instruments relating to indigenous peoples. In the Region of Antofagasta, there are a small indigenous, group the 2002 Census found that, in Antofagasta and Taltal the indigenous population was, respectively, 1.8% and 1%. 4.7% of Antofagasta region's populations were indigenous groups (INE, 2005). In Esmeraldas, the 2010 census found that most of the population is afro-ecuadorian (52.1%) with only 0.7% of indigenous population in the Esmeraldas Region (Canton). In Esmeraldas City in the Luis Vargas Torres Island, it is known that about 60 Chachi families live in the island. Chachis are an indigenous group that live in the tropical forests of the Esmeraldas province, where they reside in family-related communities (called centros Chachi). The project intervention will not affect indigenous groups or territories since construction works will be executed outside indigenous territories. In Luis Vargas Torres the early warning system which will be implemented in the island will use megaphone with siren that will be installed in the light posts. Thereby, there is no risk of harming indigenous lifestyle, wealth being, etc. Therefore, it is of great importance for the project take into considerations of this indigenous group. The pilot flood early-warning system in Luis Vargas Torres island and the communication and education strategies must consider the needs of this Chachi group. To elaborate, at the beginning of the project initiation, the Chachi families will be located at the project site and be integrated into the various project activities. It will be dealt with a particular attention on the implementation of the Narrator's Initiative and the use of their language in the communication strategies."

A robust strategy for internal risks identification and mitigation is in place since 2015 and is executed by the Risks Management Direction. The external strategy is implemented in operations financed by CAF, both in the public and in the private sector. For this project, the structure that applies in terms of risks analysis is the external one. In this case, CAF studies projects from a holistic perspective: political, institutional, financial, operational, technological, social and environmental risks are assessed and addressed with mitigation measures. The status of these risks will be monitored quarterly by the Project Manager. The former will report on the status of the risks to CAF office in Quito, who will record progress in a risk log. Risks will be reported as critical when the impact and probability are high (i.e., 5). Management responses to critical risks will be reported to the Adaptation Fund in the annual project implementation report."
